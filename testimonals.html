				<h3>Kevin Dell'Aquila</h3>
				<h4>(Bachelor's from NYU, Master of Science Candidate at Boston University)</h4>
				<p>
				It is rare to find someone as a pre-med who actually cares about you
				personally, and takes the time to learn about you both as a pre-medical
				student but also as a person. But it’s even more exceptional to find 
				someone like Dr. Kuo to be that person for you, because of the extent 
				to which she cares and takes the time to tell you in no uncertain 
				terms how much she believes in you, and what you need to do to live 
				up to her and your expectations. It’s an understatement to say meeting 
				and working with Dr. Kuo is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, because 
				I’m sure very very few people ever get the chance to work with someone
				who is this inspiring and caring at any point in their career. 
				I’m certain I’ll never forget the support she has given me, and I’m 
				fortunate to know that when times get tough as a doctor I can think 
				about her and know no obstacle is too great to overcome because of 
				life skills she has equipped me with, especially by the example she
				has set by being such an amazing person and friend. I really can’t 
				thank her enough for showing me what being a great doctor and person
				really means!
				</p>

				<h3>Marcus Calderon</h3>
				<h4>(Bachelor's from NYU, currently MD candidate at NYU Medical School)</h4>
				<p>
				Wonderful mentor and expert clinician! She helped strengthen every 
				aspect of my application and gave crucial advice to make me the best 
				candidate possible. I would not have made it into NYU School of
				Medicine without her, and she continues to provide valuable insight 
				in choosing a residency program and finding research opportunities.
				</p>
				
				<hr>
				
				<h3>Elaine Li</h3>
				<h4>(Bachelor's from City College of New York, currently MD candidate at Georgetown Medical School)</h4>
				<p>
				Dr. Kuo is the most amazing mentor a pre-med student could have.
				Not only is she a great instructor in all things medicine-related, 
				she also becomes your friend, caring about you personally. 
				I strongly believe that she was one of the main factors I'm going 
				to medical school this fall. I can't thank her enough!!!  
				</p>

				<h3>Nivedytha Indranathan</h3>
				<h4>(Bachelor's from NYU, currently MD candidate at Temple Medical School)</h4>
				<p>
				I have been working with Dr. Kuo for about three years, 
				and the advice and experience I gained from her, both 
				during and outside of rounds, have been invaluable to me. 
				During rounds, I learned how to work within a multiprofessional 
				health care team, while getting an insider's look into the 
				dynamics of health care within an underserved community. 
				And outside of rounds, Dr. Kuo was always proactively helping 
				me with my communication skills, by giving me opportunities 
				to communicate with patients and staff, and directing me to 
				relevant TED Talks and books. Today, I am able to conduct
				myself professionally within a health care setting because 
				of Dr. Kuo. She really helps her students on an individual 
				basis, and for that, I am truly grateful.
				</p>

				<h3>Shirley Zeng</h3>
				<h4>(Bachelor's from City College of New York, currently PA candidate from Touro PA Program)</h4>
				<p>
				Dr. Kuo was a great mentor. With her guidance I was able
				to excel and get into PA school. She offers great personal advice too! 
				</p>
				
				<hr>
				
				<h3>Bu Jung Kim </h3>
				<h4>(Bachelor's from NYU, currently MD candidate at FIU College of Medicine in Miami)</h4>
				<p>
				I have known her since freshman year in college.  Working as a transcriptionist and
				shadowing her during her wound rounds, I not only gained great knowledge in 
				medicine but also learned what it takes to have a career in medical field.  Dr. Kuo
				provided so much experience that helped me build characters unique and crucial to work 
				in the field.  And because she has a diverse experience in the field, she can give you the
				best advice as a doctor and mentor.  I am so grateful that I got to know Dr. Kuo.  
				Accepted to a medical school in 2015, I can surely tell you she can guide and help you 
				to be a competitive applicant.
				</p>

				<h3>Shoshana Leftin</h3>
				<h4>(Bachelor’s from NYU, MD candidate at Albert Einstein Medical School)</h4>
				<p>Dr. Kuo is not only an excellent teacher and mentor, but an inspirational
				physician who has achieved so much and cares deeply about her students. You 
				cannot have a better pre-medical experience!</p>
				
				<hr>
				
				<h3>William Kartsonis</h3>
				<h4>(Bachelor’s from NYU, Graduate Student in Biology at NYU)</h4>
				<p>I could not have asked for a better mentor and Doctor. I found Dr. Kuo 
				through the NYU Listserv years ago and started doing weekly round with her in 
				Harlem. I saw some of the most gruesome wounds (pressure ulcers, bullet wounds, 
				cancerous lesions), learned a lot about wound care, and just what it meant to be a 
				Doctor and care for your patients. Dr. Kuo would quiz us as we did rounds and joke 
				around with us. It didn't feel like work at all. I kinda miss those days, but luckily Dr. 
				Kuo and I still keep in touch. We even have lunch every now and then. Terrific lady. 
				Highly recommend working with her.</p>
