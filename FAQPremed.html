					<div id="collapse3" class="panel-collapse collapse">
					  <div class="panel-body">
					  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My admittance into NYU for both medical and law schools 
					  provides a unique perspective into the graduate admissions process.  I offer candid, 
					  firsthand insight into doctoring, healthcare, risk management, alternative career 
					  options, and much more.
					  <br>
					  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A score ago, I served as a student interviewer on the medical school admissions 
					  panel.  During this time, I first edited an essay for residency admission for an 
					  upperclassman.  That first personal favor opened a deluge of similar requests by 
					  schoolmates and friends for assistance with applications to residencies, MBA programs,
					  and scholarships for medical students and practicing physicians.  
					  <br>
					  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been a clinical preceptor to premedical students for a decade.  
					  Because of increasing requests for my input on medical school applications, I have 
					  decided to formalize my tutelage and make it available to all students. </div>

						4. Why does my child even need a consultant?  Why can’t she “do it herself?” </a>
					  </h4>
					</div>
					<div id="collapse4" class="panel-collapse collapse">
					  <div class="panel-body"> 
					  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you’re training for the Olympics or any competitive sport, you can do it yourself or 
					  you can hire a coach.  The application to medical school has now become so complicated
					  and competitive that professional help might determine success.  An experienced guide 
					  prevents costly mistakes and trials, saving the agony and the cost ($6,000+) of reapplying.
					  <br>
					  <a href = 'http://science.psu.edu/premed/docs/copy2_of_Med%20School%20Expeditures_SCI%2011-57-3.pdf'> Link </a>
					  <br>
					  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2015, there were a total of 781,602 applications to medical schools.  Only 2.63% actually 
					  matriculated!  That means your child has better odds of being diagnosed with cancer in her 
					  lifetime than setting foot in a medical school.
					  <br>
					  <a href = 'https://www.aamc.org/download/321442/data/factstablea1.pdf'> Link1 </a>
					  <br>
					  <a href = 'http://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancerbasics/lifetime-probability-of-developing-or-dying-from-cancer'> Link2 </a>
					  <br>
					  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t just save you from intensive research and potential misdirection by spoon-feeding 
					  information, I assist in packaging and presenting your child’s application to maximize success.    
					  <br>
					  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paying for MCAT preparation addresses only 12% of the application, leaving a bulk of the 
					  process unassisted!  The student who isn’t updated with the continuous evolution of the 
					  process, e.g. multiple mini interviews, climbs Mt Everest without a guide.   
					  <br>
					  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mentorship is especially invaluable for:
					  <ul>
							<li>1. students with weak MCAT or GPA scores </li>
							<li>2. weak writers </li>
							<li>3. those lacking trustworthy, knowledgeable friends/family to counsel on
							interview techniques</li>
							<li>4. those who know little of the latest changes in the admissions process </li>
							<li>5. international students </li>
							<li>6. those with weaknesses in extra-curricular activities </li>
							<li>7. those applying to competitive programs </li>
							<li>8. repeat applicants. </li>

						5. Besides, her college advisor is supposed to help her with medical school admissions.</a>
					  </h4>
					</div>
					<div id="collapse5" class="panel-collapse collapse">
					  <div class="panel-body"> 
					  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That’s great that your child has a college advisor!  Some schools don’t provide any.  
					  Some advisors might refuse to write a supporting letter of recommendation for your 
					  child.  Ultimately, there are several reasons why you don’t want to rely solely 
					  on the college advisor:
					  <br>
					  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. The average advisor to student ratio is 1:296!  Your child faces 1:296 competition 
					  for advisor attention coupled with 2.63% medical school matriculation rate. 
					  <br>
					  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boost your chances with customized, 1:1 guidance!
					  <br>
					  <a href = 'https://www.nacada.ksu.edu/Resources/Clearinghouse/View-Articles/Advisor-Load.aspx'> Link </a>
					  <br>
					  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. It is not the advisor’s job to hold hands through the admissions process!  He has so many 
					  responsibilities that he doesn’t have time for any individual graduate application.  
					  <br>
					  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Advisors counsel on course selection, ensure students complete all the requisite credits for
					  graduation, teach first year seminars, hold workshops, perform committee work, organize 
					  institutional events, and undertake many other administrative duties that detract from 
					  direct student advising!
					  <br>
					  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. I provide everything that the advisor does not.

					  <a href = 'mentorships.html'> Mentorships </a>

					  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. My experience as a doctor with active clinical experience provides a unique 
					  perspective from the other end of the tunnel. 
						<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. My mentorship encompasses more than on a cookbook recipe.  It comprehensively 
						considers the before and after of the process, e.g. assess whether medical school 
						is the suitable path, locate funds for tuition, evaluate possible career options and 
						alternatives after medical school, etc.

					  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is your brother up-to-date with the recent changes in the admissions process,

					  staff at different institutions, and with my growing network of premedical

					<div id="collapse7" class="panel-collapse collapse">
					  <div class="panel-body"> 
					  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have firsthand experience in being an admissions panel interviewer 
					  as well as a graduate school applicant to both medical schools and law schools.
					  I am a practicing physician and was a non-traditional law student, with 
					  perspective especially useful for the post-baccalaureate student. 
						<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can connect your child to research, bench-work, clinical preceptorship, and 
						paid medically-related opportunities.  If she does work with me, my letter 
						of recommendation will display an intimate knowledge of her as an individual 
						and highlight her strengths in a more personalized manner, an invaluable asset
						in any application.  
						<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because my network of premedical students, medical students, residents in training,
						and attending physicians is growing, my mentees have access to priceless
						advice about specific medical schools.
						<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No other commercial consultation services provide post-acceptance advice, e.g. 
						scholarship opportunities, first year anxiety, acing medical school, exam 
						strategies, etc.  If reapplication becomes necessary, I don’t charge those 
						enrolled in the comprehensive mentorship package (package #2).
						<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I provide personalized, individual attention for the entire process including
						the before and the after.  Other services provide no frills, cut-and-dry, 
						cookbook recipes that end when the clock strikes five.  I offer the kind of 
						limitless support and advice that any parent gives to her child except with 
						professional experience and knowledge.

						8. I already spend enough for her MCAT prep.  Why should I spend anymore on consultation?</a>
					  </h4>
					</div>
					<div id="collapse8" class="panel-collapse collapse">
					  <div class="panel-body"> 
					  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This question illustrates the very reason why you need a consultant!  MCAT is only 
					  12% of the entire application.  This isn’t an “either-or” spending. With greater than 
					  90% chance of failure in a competition against 781,590+ other applications, padding 
					  only 12% of the application isn’t enough.      
					  <br>
					  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With medical school tuition debts reaching $169,901, an investment of a few 
					  thousand dollars for your child to gain entry into medical school is a drop 
					  in the bucket.  Compare this small investment to the earning potential of a
					  physician. 
						<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My past and current students attest to the effectiveness of my mentorship.

					  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upgrades are possible but downgrades are not.  It becomes too complicated to

					  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the same reason why lawyers ask for retainers.  There is the possibility of

					<div id="collapse16" class="panel-collapse collapse">
					<div class="panel-body"> 
					  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, there will be no partial or complete refunds once services have

					  even if I log the time spent, I won’t have an identifiable total amount to charge.  
					  Secondly, other than the “introduction sessions” and “mock interviews,” I don’t 
					  limit your consultation by time so there is unlimited use of my time.  As such, 
					  I don’t have a time log.  Hourly rates for similar consultants charge anywhere 
					  from $200 to $500/hour.  My fixed price package offers buffet-style service.

					  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Questions about the mentorship are welcome at anytime.  
					  Limited, free consultation about your child’s particular admission odds is feasible,

					  <br>
					  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A student who submits an application with counsel 
					  isn’t any less qualified or capable of independent thinking than one who has.  
					  Real life medicine is team-work, whether in code resuscitations or advanced diagnosis
