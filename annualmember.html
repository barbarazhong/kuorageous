               <p>The average student usually plans too late and too little for one’s career 
			   path.  Preparing for higher education in the last year of current schooling is 
			   too late and may be too little for those with professional aspirations.  
			   Ideally, planning should begin in freshman year of high school for college 
			   admissions and in the freshman year of college for graduate school admissions.  
			   </p>
			   
                <p>
				<ul>Consulting in preparation for higher education and career:
					<li>Live “getting to know your profile” strategy session with 
					advice on academic and career path   </li>
					<li>For those who are undecided in career path, this would 
					be a great time to explore different career options that 
					would best suit the student’s personality, interests, and abilities</li>
					<li>For those who are determined to pursue a specific career, 
					this would be time to judiciously select courses that highlight 
					strengths in certain subjects in preparation for college and 
					specialty (graduate) school applications </li>
					<li>Evaluation of school transcript and troubleshooting, e.g. link 
					to commercial prep courses and private tutors after personalized 
					selection for quality to fortify weaknesses.  We offer to negotiate 
					discounts with private tutors (e.g. standardized exams such as 
					SAT, MCAT, LSAT, GMAT, high school prep courses, college courses, 
					basic science classes).</li>
					<li>Establishing optimal time management for becoming an effective student</li>
					<li>Strategic use of extracurricular time (weekends, evenings, and summers)
					to engage in meaningful and constructive (while still fun and interesting) 
					activities </li>
					<li>Suggestions for summer programs, weekend programs, and other 
					extracurricular programs that would enhance the student’s overall 
					non-academic profile on admissions applications </li>
					<li>Connections to volunteer opportunities, internships, and research opportunities </li>
					<li>Building resume for a stronger profile, personal growth, and brighter future</li>
					<li>Start the admissions process early by practicing essay writing skills</li>
					<li>Building skills in proper professional etiquette, public speaking, 
					interacting with working professionals in “the real world”</li>
					<li>Grooming the student for maturity (mature decision making and social interactions) </li>
					<li>Coping with stress (challenging courses, standardized exam preparation, 
					application process, etc.) </li>
					<li>Unlimited general advice (by email) that is always prompt and responsive</li>
					<li>Always personalized, customized attention</li>
				</ul>

			<dd>1. There will be no refunds, partial or complete, once services have begun to be rendered. 
			If you decide midway through the application process that you are not interested anymore 
			after all, we can discuss whether it is feasible to apply the remainder of your unused 
			services for applying to schools of another discipline </dd>
			<dd>2. Unfortunately, we do not provide “a la carte” services where you can pick and choose
			to subscribe to a specific service, e.g. essay edits, mock interviews. 
			We provide comprehensive packages because the best way to help you is to polish every aspect 
			of your application.  We want to maximize your chances of admissions. Being involved in only 
			bits and pieces deters us from discovering potential weaknesses in your application. 
			Your success is key to our success! </dd>
			<dd>3. Much of this mentorship can be achieved remotely, if geographic location bars you 
			from in-person meetings. So if you are not physically located in New York City but are 
			still interested in enrolling my assistance, please contact us anyway, so we can discuss 
			possible options. </dd>
